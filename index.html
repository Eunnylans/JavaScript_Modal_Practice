        A modal (also called a modal window or lightbox) is a web page element
        that displays in front of and deactivates all other page content. To
        return to the main content, the user must engage with the modal by
        completing an action or by closing it. What is the difference between
        popup and modal? Modals, like pop-ups, are components that pop up on a
        user's screen. The key difference, however, is that the user would have
        initiated the action as part of their journey. Modals are used for
        specific workflows such as adding users, deleting content, sharing
        content, adding content, and more.
